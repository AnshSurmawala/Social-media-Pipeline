# Social Media Data Pipeline

A Python-based social media data pipeline with producer-consumer architecture for real-time data processing.

## Overview

This pipeline simulates social media data generation and processes it using a queue-based architecture. It consists of:

- **Producer**: Generates simulated social media posts with realistic data structure
- **Consumer**: Processes the generated data with validation and transformation
- **Queue**: In-memory data transfer mechanism between components

## Features

- Concurrent data production and consumption using threading
- JSON-based data serialization
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring
- Error handling and data validation
- Modular, reusable components
- Real-time data processing capabilities
